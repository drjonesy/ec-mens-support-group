## Give Me An Answer

## The Book of Leviticus

**Sept. 2024 - Dec. 2024**

After learning how to read the bible we decided to try and study the book of Leviticus which can be a bit daunting, especially for new believiers. However, with a better understanding of how the bible organized the group felt confident in pursuing this book. We initially covered a chapter per week but then realized it was best to group the book into sections since we only meet up once a week.
