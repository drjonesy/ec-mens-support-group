# Weekly Newsletter

<div class="box">Date: November 13, 2024 @ 6:30 PM</div>

Welcome to the weekly newsletter. This newsletter contains the topic we are covering for the coming Wednesday night group. This is our generalized fall back topic. However, if there is something you'd like share with the group, you need group prayer, or something else that edifies Jesus Christ, please bring it up.

## ðŸ“Œ Give Me An Answer (Week 1)

For the next topic weâ€™ll jump into discussions on common and difficult questions asked by non-believers.

To supplement these questions and keep us moving forward, weâ€™ll be using the book â€œGive Me An Answer by Cliffe Knechtleâ€œ. This book will simply be a guide, but we must be willing to challenge our knowledge and willing seek understanding. This chapter will only be available up to the day of the study and then it will be removed.
