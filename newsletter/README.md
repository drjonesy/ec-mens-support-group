# Weekly Newsletter

<div class="box">Date: November 13, 2024 @ 6:30 PM</div>

Welcome to the weekly newsletter. This newsletter contains the topic we are covering for the coming Wednesday night group. This is our generalized fall back topic. However, if there is something you'd like share with the group, you need group prayer, or something else that edifies Jesus Christ, please bring it up.

## 📌 Leviticus 11-15 | Ritual Purity

## ↪️ After Leviticus

Now that we are grouping the sections of Leviticus, we will likely be done in six weeks. For the next topic we’ll jump into discussions on common and difficult questions asked by non-believers.

To supplement these questions and keep us moving forward, we’ll be using the book “Give Me An Answer by Cliffe Knechtle“. This book will simply be a guide, but we must be willing to challenge our knowledge and willing seek understanding. If you’d like to get a copy yourself, you may want to order it a couple weeks before we start.

!> **Example Question**<br />
Are those who have never heard about Christ going to Hell?
